# Identification-of-Diabetes-and-Prediction-of-Insulin-Dosage

In the following code, we have utilized two datasets. One is to identify whether the patient has diabetes and other datasets to predict the amount of insulin dosage to be given. XG Boost algorithm was used in the code to determine whether or not a patient has diabetes, and then further to predict the insulin dosage, the Linear Regression algorithm was used. To make the following project user-friendly, tkinter concept was also applied, which helped build an application with python to make the process handy and more accessible for the user.

diabetes.csv and insulin_dosage.csv are the two files related to the Machine Learning Project, wherein they both are the files used to train the model, whereas testValues.csv is to test the model's accuracy.
