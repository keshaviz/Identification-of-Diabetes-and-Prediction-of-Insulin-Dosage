# Identification-of-Diabetes-and-Prediction-of-Insulin-Dosage

Machine learning Project: In the following code we have utilized two datasets. One to identify whether the patient has diabetes or not and other dataset to predict the amount of insulin dosage to be given. XG Boost algorithm was used in the code to identify whether or not a patient has diabetes and then further to predict the insulin dosage , Linear Regression algorithm was used. To make the following project user friendly, tkinter concept was also applied which helped in building an application with python to make the process handy and easier for the user.

diabetes.csv and insulin_dosage.csv, are the two files which are related to the Machine Learning Project, wherein they both are the files are used to train the model whereas testValues.csv is just to test the models accuracy.
